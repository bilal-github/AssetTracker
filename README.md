# AssetTracker
AssetTracker is a simple application that allows customers to list all their high-value items and calculate the total content limits required in case of an insurance claim.

# How to run the project
1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `Appsettings.json` file and update the `Data source` in the connection string. (currently set to `"."`).
3. Open the `Program.cs` file and pass in the same `Data source` (currently passing `"."`) into the SetupDatabase method.

## This is how the UI will look after the first run
