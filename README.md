# AssetTracker
AssetTracker is a simple application that allows customers to list all their high-value items and calculate the total content limits required in case of an insurance claim.

# How to run the project
1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open the Appsettings.json file and update the Datasource to your own database connection string.
3. Open the program.cs file and pass in the same Datasource into the SetupDatabase method.

## This is how the UI will look after the first run
